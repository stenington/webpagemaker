          Learning by making. Webmaker projects are designed to help you make something amazing on the web fast.
          Using Mozilla Webmaker tools like Popcorn, Hackasaurus and the Thimble App, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>take apart and remix web sites,</li>
          <li>make your own webpages, interactive videos and other cool stuff in minutes,</li>
          <li>sharpen your webmaking skills. From HTML and CSS to fancy stuff.</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>
          We're preparing a set of these projects for the Mozilla Summer Code Party. The goal: teach the world the basics of coding and webmaking. Through bite-sized games, projects and recipes that are easy, social and fun. Partners and contributors will be able to share their own webmaker projects as well.
