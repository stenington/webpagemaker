          Get your feet wet with Thimble by trying some of our fun
          projects. Thimble projects are hackable webpages that allow
          you to complete a challenge, play a game or build something
          cool by editing the code of the page, and learning webmaking
          skills like HTML and CSS in the process. Choose a project
          below that interests you to get started.
