                      Share fully functional web pages with one click.
                      Webpage Maker isn't just a learning tool or toy. It lets you create your own real, fully functional web pages -- for your band, your pet rock, your business, or whatever -- and then share them with a click. There's also plenty of starter projects and templates to help you make something amazing quickly.
                      Webmaking made easy.
                      Mozilla is a non-profit that believes everyone should be able to make and share with the open web. But creating, hosting or tweaking your own stuff is often still too difficult -- with obstacles like learning HTML and CSS, struggling with servers to preview your work, or figuring out where your content will live online. Webpage Maker clears away those barriers, making it easier to create your own projects quickly and learn web skills in a way that's easy, visual and fun.
