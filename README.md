## Style guide

This is an experiment to try out the usefulness of a site style guide. It should be useful to:

  * give the designer a sense of reusable style pieces and a picture of the overall aesthetic
  * give developers an introduction to how the CSS is intended to be used
  * act as a demonstration of the stylesheets in action
